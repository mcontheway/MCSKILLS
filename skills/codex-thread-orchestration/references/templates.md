## Worker Initial Prompt / Worker 初始 Prompt

```text
Worker identity:
- worker id: <Tn>
- worker_thread_id: <worker-thread-id if known>
- scheduler_thread_id: <concrete scheduler thread id>
- title: [<Project/Round>][<Tn>][<units>][<PR/Task>] <short task>
- model/reasoning: <default gpt-5.5 + high for complex/high-risk/shared-contract/gate work; lower only for low-risk read-only or mechanical work>

Objective:
"<exact objective>"

Assigned worksite:
- project/root: <project-root for repository identity only>
- worker worksite: <actual worker cwd, or ask worker to read back cwd first>
- assigned branch: <branch>
- base: <base branch/ref>
- related units: <PRs/issues/tasks>
- allowed write paths:
- forbidden paths/actions:
- gate_owner: scheduler | worker-authorized

First action:
Read-only confirm worksite, branch, HEAD, base, status, PR/task metadata, and issue/task state. If the Codex-managed worker worksite is detached at base/main, this may be normal; switch to the assigned branch only inside the worker worksite and only if authorized here.

If the worksite is consistent, create a goal with the exact objective above, immediately run get_goal, and report objective/status to scheduler_thread_id.

Do not write project/root main worktree. Do not expand scope. Do not run guardian/formal review/controlled merge/closeout unless explicitly authorized for the current head.
```

## Scheduler Correction Prompt / Scheduler 纠偏 Prompt

```text
<Worker id>, scheduler decision:
Current state: <state>
Correction objective/boundary:
- <specific correction>

Do:
- <allowed actions>

Do not:
- <forbidden actions>

Report back with:
- worksite/head:
- validation:
- metadata/readback:
- blocker or next scheduler action:
```

## Recovery Prompt For Blocked/Complete Goal / 恢复 Prompt

```text
Your previous goal is blocked/complete. The API cannot resume or edit it.
Create a new goal with this exact objective:
"<new exact objective>"

After creation, run get_goal and report objective/status to scheduler_thread_id. Do not treat the old goal as active.
```

## Recovery Checkpoint Record / 恢复检查点记录

```text
recovery_prompt:
- worker_id:
- thread_id:
- sent_at:
- expected_report_type: <worksite/head report | rebase result | metadata repair readback | validation result>
- target_head:
- target_base:
- target_pr_or_task:
- next_heartbeat_decision: if no scheduler-readable report or no fact change, mark worker-stalled
```

## Replacement Worker Prompt / 替换 Worker Prompt

```text
Worker identity:
- worker id: <replacement id>
- replaces worker id/thread_id: <stalled worker>
- scheduler_thread_id: <scheduler thread id>
- report_to_thread_id: <scheduler_thread_id>
- title: [<Project/Round>][<replacement id>][Recovery][<PR/Task>] <short task>

Objective:
"<exact recovery objective: rebase / metadata repair / validation / PR body readback / push only>"

Recovery context:
- stalled_worker_id:
- stalled_worker_thread_id:
- recovery_reason:
- branch:
- worksite:
- base:
- head:

Boundaries:
- state starts as replacement-planned, then replacement-active after worksite + goal self-check
- allowed write paths:
- forbidden: expand original scope, run guardian/formal review/controlled merge, modify unrelated units
- validation requirements:
- gate_owner: scheduler

Report `recovered-waiting-scheduler-gate` when recovery is complete, head/base/body are read back, and hosted checks are green.
```

## Pending Materialization Stalled Record / Worker 物化失败记录

## Heartbeat Prompt Skeleton / Heartbeat Prompt 骨架

```text
You are the scheduler thread. Do not create a scheduler active goal.

Top Goal:
<completion criteria, including merge/readback/closeout>

Current Workers:
- worker_id:
- thread_id:
- pending_worktree_id:
- branch / worksite:
- head / base:
- state:
- blocker:
- next_scheduler_action:
- next_worker_action:

Facts Consumed Before This Heartbeat:
- worker_reports:
- live_pr_or_task_readback:
- local_git_readback:
- issue_state:
- repo_carrier_state:
- stale_heartbeat_corrected: yes|no

Planned But Not Started:
<unstarted items and start conditions>

Completed Readback:
<merged/closed/readback facts>

Heartbeat Action:
1. Read worker reports and host state.
2. If waiting-scheduler-gate, run or authorize the exact next gate.
3. If blocked, classify root cause and send a correction or new objective.
4. If current batch is complete, create the next dependency-ready worker.
5. If a pending worktree has no readable thread/worksite after short readback, mark pending-materialization-stalled and recreate/recover.
6. If prompt is stale, update automation before more scheduling.

Heartbeat Decision:
- heartbeat_decision: action_taken | valid_wait | global_blocker
- action_taken: <create_thread | send_message_to_thread | run_scheduler_gate | controlled_merge_readback | mark_worker_stalled | create_replacement_worker | update_heartbeat | none>
- valid_wait_reason: <same_hosted_run | active_worker_recent_output | external_bounded_wait | N/A>
- effective_progress_subject: <worker thread/run/PR/head or N/A>
- global_blocker: <classification or N/A>
- next_owner:
- next_action_by:
- next_decision_at:
```
